# Arduino_Logitech_3D_Joystick
Arduino library for interfacing with the "Logitech Extreme 3D Pro Joystick". This is a more intuitive "safer"  version of the "le3dp_rptparser" library.

WHAT YOU WILL NEED:
You will need to have USB hosting available on your arduino (i.e. Arduino Mega or Arduino USB Host Shield).
You will also need to download the library : "USB_Host_Shield_2.0-master". These programs rely on UsbHid and several others within the library. 

Happy coding,
Ben
